# AirSight
AirSight is a real-time multimodal drone detection system that uses both camera and microphone data. It combines CNN-based visual features with MFCC audio features in a lightweight neural network, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices like Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi.

---

## 🧠 Overview

AirSight leverages two sensory modalities—image and sound—for robust drone classification. It is built on PyTorch and OpenCV and supports live webcam feed and microphone input for continuous detection.

### Key Features
- 🖼️ **Visual Detection**: Captures and processes 64x64 RGB frames from a webcam.
- 🔊 **Audio Detection**: Captures 1-second microphone samples and extracts MFCCs.
- 🧩 **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines visual and audio features in a neural network.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Inference**: Fast enough for real-time classification.
- 📦 **Lightweight Model**: Designed to run on laptops and edge devices.

## 📊 Model Architecture

```text
Image Input  → CNN (Conv → ReLU → Pool → Flatten)
Audio Input  → MFCC → Linear → ReLU
              ↓
          Concatenate → Linear → Softmax
```

## 🧪 Training (Optional)

Training scripts are not included but the dataset was created by pairing:

- **Images** from: [Drone Type Classification (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balajikartheek/drone-type-classification)
- **Audio** from: [Drone Audio Dataset (GitHub)](https://github.com/saraalemadi/DroneAudioDataset)

Each image-audio pair was labeled as "Drone" or "No Drone".
